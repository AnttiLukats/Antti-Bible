Pandora hash
============
the hash also contained in the file "box.txt" being B16F8501B9C596F0DC34B8805C84D656ACDCDC2E2F15A7F502D752018570C5753F196BC749C5BCADB37CBC0D54D2414D9915D53277235C8F0579CC2B0E2B46CF

is made from another SHA512 hash + cryptographically stron password

hash_one = sha512(answer to question: where?)
hash_box = sha512(hash_one + password)

I, Antti Lukats herewith assure that the pandora hash is really the first hash I created from the first password I used, so the fact that it begins with "B1" is pure randomness!
